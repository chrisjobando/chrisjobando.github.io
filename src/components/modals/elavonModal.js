              i was very fortunate to join the bridge team right at the start of
              a major refactor.

            <p>
              i learned the ins and outs of the new code-base and had my first
              true opportunity to apply the fundamentals of{' '}
              <span className="bold">java</span> from my first two years at
              georgia tech towards a real-world software solution.

            <p>
              i not only got to review and contribute to code that handled over
              <span className="bold"> $12.5 billion</span> in sales in 2019, but
              i also worked on a <span className="bold">scrum</span> team and
              was able to present my research and work with the entire team
              during our daily standups and biweekly retrospectives.

              i would like to thank my hiring manager{' '}

              throughout the recruitment process as well as for checking up on
              me every other week, our engineering lead{' '}
